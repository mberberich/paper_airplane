# How to make a square paper airplane
8 May 2017

## Materials
* One sheet of 8.5 x 11" paper
* Two hands (preferable)
* A table or other flat working surface

## Instructions

1. Place the sheet of paper on the table in front of you portrait style.
2. Starting at the bottom, make a 1-1.5" fold by brining the bottom edge toward the top edge. You should be folding horizontally. 
3. Repeat step two until you have made 1-1.5" folds along half of the paper. 
4. Flip the paper over so that the fold is on the table and the folded edge is still the closest edge to you. 
5. Now, fold the paper *vertically* in half. To do this, bring the left edge of the paper to touch the right edge of the paper and crease. 
6. The paper should still be folded in half for this step. We are simply going to rotate the paper. Rotate the paper so that your newly created crease is the closest edge to you (if you followed Step 5 exactly, you should be rotating counterclockwise by a quarter turn).
7. To make one wing, fold the top edge of the paper down toward you, leaving about 1" at the bottom.
8. Flip the paper over and repeat Step 7 to make the other wing.
9. Test out the paper airplane!
